      <h2>Step 1: Install Partiality</h2>
      <p class="note">Steps by Zandra with some minor modifications.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Download <a href="https://github.com/PartialityModding/PartialityLauncher/releases">Partiality</a>
          <img src="images/" alt="Screenshot of Partiality Releases Page">
        </li>
        <li>Extract the .zip file anywhere you want.</li>
        <li>Run "Partiality Launcher.bat"</li>
        <li>Press "File" at the top, then "Open Game"</li>
        <li>Find your game's .exe and select it</li>
        <li>Once you have it selected, press "Patch Game" at the bottom.</li>
        <li>It will patch the game and create folders for you</li>
        <li>Navigate to the game's folder</li>
        <li>Put mods in the "Mods" folder</li>
        <li>Re-Launch partiality, and enable/disable mods as you need. Press "Patch Game" whenever you're ready, and press "Yes" when it asks you to launch the game.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 2: Install Abraxis Toolset</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Download <a href="https://github.com/Cut2TheChase/AbraxisToolset/releases">Abraxis Toolset</a>
          <img src="images/" alt="Screenshot of Abraxis Toolset Releases Page">
        </li>
        <li>Extract the .rar file anywhere you want.
          <p class="note">(Look at that README.txt file existing, literally insisting that you read it. It will tell you to...)</p>
        </li>
        <li>Place AbraxisToolset.dll into Necropolis/Mods</li>
        <li>Place discord-rpc.dll into Necropolis/Plugins</li>
        <li>In Partiality, click refresh, then click the Abraxis Toolset checkbox, then click "patch game"</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 3: Adding Mods</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Download the mods you want to install. For this example, we'll use <a href="https://github.com/Cut2TheChase/ZekesNewThrowables/releases">Zeke's New Throwables</a>.
          <p class="note">Downloads should be from the mod's "releases" page if they're from Github otherwise you're probably getting the wrong files.</p>
          <img src="" alt="Zeke's New Throwables Releases Page Screenshot">
        </li>
        <li>Extract the .zip or .rar file anywhere you want.
          <p class="note">(Preferably somewhere you can find it later)</p>
          <img src="images/ZNTFolder.png" alt="Zeke's New Throwables Downloaded Folder">
        </li>
        <li>Place folders containing the CSV files into Necropolis/Mods
          <p class="note">Unless the mod's instructions specify otherwise.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Place .dlls into Necropolis/Mods
          <p class="note">Unless the mod's instructions specify otherwise.</p>
        </li>
        <li>At the end of this process, your mods folder should look something like this:
          <img src="images/NecroModsInstalled.png" alt="Mods Folder With Mods Installed">
        </li>
        <li>In Partiality, refresh the mod list, then select the mods you want to patch in, and patch the game.
          <p class="note">For simplicity, assume that ALL mods require Abraxis Toolset to be patched in.</p>
          <p class="note">Partiality only detects .dll files. If a mod only uses CSVs it will be patched in when the game starts by Abraxis Toolset as long as they are in the mods folder.</p>
          <p class="note">Don't change the names of any mod files or you will probably break something.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 4: Fixing problems</h2>
      <p>If there's an infinite load screen: verify integrity of local files through steam. Patch the game with only Abraxis checked. Then patch the game with your mods of choice.</p>
