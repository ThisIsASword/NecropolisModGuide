        <li>Extract the .zip file anywhere you want.</li>
        <li>Run "Partiality Launcher.bat"</li>
        <li>Press "File" at the top, then "Open Game"</li>
        <li>Find your game's .exe and select it</li>
        <li>Once you have it selected, press "Patch Game" at the bottom.</li>
        <li>It will patch the game and create folders for you</li>
        <li>Navigate to the game's folder</li>
        <li>Put mods in the "Mods" folder</li>
        <li>Re-Launch partiality, and enable/disable mods as you need. Press "Patch Game" whenever you're ready, and press "Yes" when it asks you to launch the game.</li>
